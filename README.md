# Kanban-Style

Kanban-Style provides a Kanban style view of a Pivotal Tracker project. It uses a large font so stories are readable during standup.

Kanban-Style shows your Pivotal project as 3 distinct streams: `done`, `in-progress` and `todo`. 
The `done` column is sectioned into days, so it's easy to see on which stories were accepted yesterday.

At daily standup, it's often hard for everyone to see the standard Pivotal Tracker project view so Kanban-Style uses a large font size.
If the font's still not big enough then zoom your browser window - Kanban-Style zooms nicely.
